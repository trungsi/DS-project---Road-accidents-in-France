    -1: Uknown
    The overall severity of an accident can be seen as an aggregation of severity of all passengers impacted.
    
    The severity can be converted to numerical values as below.
    
    Severity    Value
    Ininjured (1), Unknown (-1)    0
    Slightly injured (4)    3
    Injured, in hispital (3)    7
    Killed (2)    13

    Then we can use regression to predict the severity. It could then be used in insurance to predict the claim costs.'''
